# Semester Planner

This app lets an instructor plan a semester (or term or trimester) by dragging and dropping
assignment and topic ideas around a calendar grid. It contains a simple backend server (Flask-based)
that stores your plans in Google Cloud NDB.

I wrote this in 2016 when I was a new college teacher. It's simplistic, but it helped me plan, and
it also let me experiment with Angular and jQuery UI. Nowadays, you'd write this with different
technologies. Even back than you'd have written it differently, i.e., you'd have written better code
than I did!

I'm putting this in a public repo because ... I can. :-)
